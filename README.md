Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the development of a simple question-answering chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to provide static responses based on a predefined dataset of questions and answers. Key features of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: The chatbot preprocesses user input and stored questions by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing the words. This ensures that the chatbot can effectively match user queries with the corresponding answers in the dataset.

User Interaction: The chatbot provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their questions. It responds with the appropriate answer if a match is found in the dataset, or it informs the user if no answer is available.

Extensibility: The current implementation can be easily extended by adding more questions and answers to the dataset, allowing for a broader range of queries and responses.

NLP Libraries: The project utilizes the NLTK library for various NLP tasks, showcasing the power of Python in handling text data.
